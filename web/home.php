  <h2>The Puppies Journey </h2> 
  
  <p> Hover over pictures to see them grow! </p>
  <p>My family has a wonderful dog named Coco (on Right), she is half toy poodle and half pug. This year our family decided it would be a fun adventure to have puppies! Bennie (on left) is a dog that lives down the street and the dad to our puppies. </p>

  <p>Coco Bean got so big that she barely fit in her sweater!</p>

  <p>Then one day at 5 in the morning she had six puppies. We were hoping for four puppies, so we were amazed that six puppies could fit inside her! </p>

  <p>The puppies were so small they could fit in one hand. </p>

  <p>Then they grew so you had to use two hands to hold them</p>
